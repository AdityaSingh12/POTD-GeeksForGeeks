"""
Max_sum_path_in_two_arrays

Given two sorted arrays of distinct integers arr1 and arr2. 
Each array may have some elements in common with the other array. 
Find the maximum sum of a path from the beginning of any array to the end of any array. 
You can switch from one array to another array only at the common elements.

Note:  When we switch from one array to other, 
we need to consider the common element only once in the result.
